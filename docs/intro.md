# Humanoid Robotics & Physical AI Course Book

## Welcome to Humanoid Robotics

This comprehensive course book covers the essential concepts and practical applications of humanoid robotics and physical AI. Designed for students learning embodied AI, robotics engineering, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems, this book provides both theoretical foundations and hands-on implementation guidance.

## Course Structure

The book is organized into several key modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Core concepts and architecture of the Robot Operating System
- **Digital Twin Simulation**: Gazebo and Unity simulation environments for robot development
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: Advanced robotics platform for AI-powered robots
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Integration of perception, reasoning, and action
- **Capstone Humanoid Project**: Complete implementation of a humanoid robot system
- **Hardware Guide**: Practical guidance on workstations, Jetson kits, sensors, and robot platforms

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create and validate robot behaviors in simulation environments
- Integrate AI models for perception and decision-making
- Deploy robotic systems to physical hardware
- Build complete humanoid robot systems from simulation to real-world deployment

## Target Audience

This course is designed for intermediate-to-advanced engineering students and professionals who want to understand modern approaches to humanoid robotics. A background in programming, basic robotics concepts, and linear algebra is recommended.

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:
1. **Overview**: High-level introduction to the topic
2. **Theory**: Theoretical foundations and concepts
3. **Implementation**: Practical implementation details
4. **Examples**: Concrete examples with code
5. **Applications**: Real-world applications and use cases

Additionally, each chapter includes exercises to reinforce learning and numbered citations for all technical claims.
