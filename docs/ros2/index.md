# ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Module Overview

The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is the cornerstone of modern robotics development and serves as the foundation for humanoid robotics applications. This module provides comprehensive coverage of ROS 2 concepts, architecture, and practical implementation approaches that will be essential throughout the course.

ROS 2 is not an operating system but rather a middleware framework that provides services designed for a heterogeneous computer cluster. It includes hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more [1].

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 packages and workspaces
- Implement basic ROS 2 nodes and understand communication patterns
- Work with topics, services, and actions for inter-process communication
- Design simple robotic systems using ROS 2 components

## Module Structure

This module is organized according to the standard structure for this course book:

- **Overview**: High-level introduction to ROS 2 and its role in humanoid robotics [1]
- **Theory**: Theoretical foundations and core concepts of ROS 2 architecture [2]
- **Implementation**: Practical setup and configuration of ROS 2 environments [3]
- **Examples**: Concrete examples with code implementations [4]
- **Applications**: Real-world applications and use cases in humanoid robotics [5]

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic programming experience in Python or C++
- Understanding of computer networking concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts (optional but helpful)

## Course Integration

The concepts learned in this module will be foundational for:
- Digital twin simulation (Module 2)
- NVIDIA Isaac integration (Module 3)
- Vision-Language-Action systems (Module 4)
- The capstone humanoid project (Module 5)
